## 🆘 Getting Help

### Common Issues

**Problem: Query is slow**
- Check if indexes exist
- Use EXPLAIN to analyze
- Review Session 2 optimization techniques

**Problem: Window function not working**
- Check PARTITION BY syntax
- Verify ORDER BY is correct
- Review frame specification

**Problem: Normalization confusion**
- Start with 1NF (atomic values)
- Then 2NF (remove partial dependencies)
- Finally 3NF (remove transitive dependencies)

**Problem: Can't answer business question**
- Break it into smaller parts
- Identify required tables
- Think about joins needed
- Use CTEs for complex logic
